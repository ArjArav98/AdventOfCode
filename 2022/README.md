# AdventOfCode2022
A collection of answers to all the programming questions for Advent of Code 2022.


I'm attempting each of the questions in C++ 17. I thought AoC would be a nice way to learn this version of the language. I have to say, I've been having a lot of fun doing this. Maybe too much fun. 


Feel free to go through the solutions if you want. To execute the programs, you can run the following snippet.


```
# Make sure you're in the repository's root folder.
c++ -std=c++17 <filename>.cpp
./a.out
```

[To attempt the questions yourself, you can visit this year's 'Advent of Code' website.](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
